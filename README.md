# Challenge-Week1 - Horiseon

## Description 

This project is a fully functional webpage for the Horiseon marketing agency. This webpage is optimised for desktop, laptop, tablets and mobile phones.

This project was focused on accessibility to improve seo. The code for this webpage closely follows accessibility standards by using alt attributes for all img elements, using the viewport attribute to ensure the webpage is properly displayed on a variety of devices and the codebase has been condensed and optimised.
